The statue is looking directly to the west. There is a legend about this place: A woman visited The Mountain of Sunsets each day to pray and to watch sunsets. However, one day she didn't pray because she only wanted to watch the sunset. Suddenly, angels descended from heaven and turned her to stone for her laziness. Moral of the story? Pray, I guess. But you're a demon hunter so I think you are welcome in heaven even without praying.","name":"The Mountain of Sunset","goldReward":4,"xpReward":6,"time":426000},{"description":"This huge and expensive church was built to worship one of the Seven Heavenly Virtues - Michael. Michael is the virtue of Charity, so mostly only the poor gathered in this church to pray. The church was small and plain at first, but as wars, famines and plagues decimated the land, more people began visiting the church. Michael became the most worhiped angel. The church grew in size, more decorations were added and two huge statues of Michael were made to attract more even people. Perhaps, after this reconstruction, people only visited this place to feel wealthy and to be surrounded by luxurious objects. Now, after the Armageddon, nobody visits this pompous church anymore.  Still, I think you should check it out. That place gives me the creeps for some reason.","name":"Church of Michael","goldReward":10,"xpReward":2,"time":511200},{"description":"Why the hell would anyone build something like this? What's the point? We have graves, tombs and other things but someone had the brilliant idea to decorate a church with bones.  The bones belong to the priests of this church. They let other priests decorate the church with their bones after they die.
