After some time he lost all of his humanity and turned into something simillar to a demon. After this he fought demons and even angels. Nobody knows how he died but everyone is glad that he is gone. He was more terrifying than some demons.  All kinds of demons visit his grave. They think Alastor's power is sealed in his axe. They want to steal it. So maybe don't let that happen.",

The church was small and plain at first, but as wars, famines and plagues decimated the land, more people began visiting the church. Michael became the most worhiped angel. The church grew in size, more decorations were added and two huge statues of Michael were made to attract more even people. Perhaps, after this reconstruction, people only visited this place to feel wealthy and to be surrounded by luxurious objects. Now, after the Armageddon, nobody visits this pompous church anymore.  Still, I think you should check it out. That place gives me the creeps for some reason.",

The town under it is completely destroyed but the castle is untouched. The Old King must have really loved himself. This castle is as huge as his ego. Well, now The Sin of Pride himself lives there.

Not only to sell them for a lot of money, but also to bring them home. Most of the miners froze to death or died of exhaustion. And the few that returned carried bags full of blood. You could try to find some of these red stones but bringing them to Sanctuary is impossible. So just look for some powerful monsters there. At least I think that's what you're good at.",

The demons appeared and destroyed almost everything except the capital city and King's Castle. The Ravens fought the demons on the plains near the capital. The battle was quite quick, the Ravens were completely wiped out. However, they were the only ones that opposed the demons. The plains are now called the Plains of Phantoms.
